# Jubelio-test

# How to run the script

requirements:
1. python
2. pytest
3. pytest-html
4. selenium webdriver

step:
1. clone or download this repo
2. open your text editor in #Jubelio-test particular directory 
3. or you can directly run in terminal with #Jubelio-test particular directory
4. use "pytest login.py --html=loginreport.html" command to run login test
5. use "pytest stock.py --html=stockreport.html" command to run edit stock test


NB:
All report-html will be generated automatically in local repo, however unfortunatelly i still cannot include screenshot to report-html, so it still separated in screenshot folder.
